1. Virus Tottal recongize the md5 as malicious.

2. Using PEview software -> under IMAGE_FILE_HEADER there is the timesamp. the time stamp is 2010/12/19 16:16:19.

3. The file doesn't seem to be unpacked. Running the file with PEid shows that the file was compiled by visual studio.
In addition, comparing text, Rdata and data's disk to ram memory allocations, Doesn't show significant differnces of sizes.

4. Under the section Rdata of the PE file, the imports and the exports are stored. I will use DependencyWalker to navigate through the Rdata.
opening the Rdata, shows that the exe is creating,copying and searching files.
Using the String exe, which provides a way to look for the strings that are running under the exe, I examined the Lab01-01.dll.
I will investigate it next.

5. Under the data section of the exe, which stores global data to use by the program, I noticed kerne132.dll. a good guese is that the exe can look for this malicous dll
and disguise itself to kernel32.dll.

6. Examining the  Lab01-01.dll strings, shows an ip adress. another network indicator is WSN_32.dll which is dll for network related actions.
